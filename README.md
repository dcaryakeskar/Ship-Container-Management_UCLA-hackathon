**Chapter 1: Introduction to Project 1.1-Project Description** 

The provided C++ program is a Container Management System that allows users to allocate, display, and manage containers. It supports both undamaged and damaged containers, offering features like enqueuing damaged containers for repair. The system's core structure includes classes for container management, a queue for damaged containers, and a menu- driven interface for user interaction. This program serves as a basic foundation for container management and can be extended to include more advanced features and error handling.

**1.2-Project Application** 

The Container Management System is a software application designed to streamline the allocation, monitoring, and maintenance of containers. It simplifies container management for organizations that need to track various container attributes, including client information, location, status (damaged or undamaged), and availability dates. Users can allocate new containers, view the existing container information, and efficiently manage damaged containers. This application enhances container organization and simplifies the repair process.

**1.3 Scope** 

The scope of the Container Management System includes creating a software application that facilitates the allocation and monitoring of containers, with a focus on both damaged and undamaged containers. The system allows users to allocate containers, view container details, enqueue damaged containers for repair, and repair them. The application aims to streamline container management, making it more efficient and organized for users and organizations dealing with containers.

**Chapter 2: Project Functionalities** 

1. **Functionalities** 

The Container Management System includes the following key functionalities:

- *Allocate Containers:* Users can allocate containers by providing details such as client name, location, date of availability, and the status (damaged or undamaged).
- *Display Containers:* The system allows users to view the details of all allocated containers, including client name, location, status, and availability dates.
- Enqueue Damaged Containers: Damaged containers can be enqueued for repair by specifying their container numbers.
